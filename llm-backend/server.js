/**
 * Enhanced LLM Backend Server
 * 
 * This server provides a compatibility layer between the KAIROS platform and open-source LLMs.
 * It supports multiple open source AI models via Ollama:
 * 
 * - Google Gemma 2
 * - LLaMA 2/3
 * - Mistral AI
 * - Command R/R+
 * - Falcon 2 (image generation)
 * - Grok 1.5
 * - Bloom
 * - Pythia
 * - FastChat-T5
 * 
 * It implements a compatible API layer to replace DevvAI functionality.
